Moving Previously Installed Origin Games
========================================

Steps marked with * are optional and are merely for later convenience

1. Create "Origin Games" folder in desired location*
2. Copy (or cut) Battlefield 3 folder to the newly created folder
3. Rename original BF3 folder if you'd like to keep the files*
4. Uninstall BF3 through add/remove programs
5. Change Origin install location to the folder that contains your new copy of BF3 (Origin Games if you followed step 1).
6. Restart Origin
7. BF3 should now say "ready to install," click this and it will go through a quick install (couple minutes)
8. Start up BF3 and everything should be exactly as it was
