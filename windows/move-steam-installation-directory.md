Moving Steam Installation Directory
===================================

## Warning:

It is highly recommended that you create a backup of your 
SteamApps folder before attempting this process. If there 
is a problem in this process and you do not have a backup 
of your games or the SteamApps folder, it will be necessary 
to reinstall the games individually. Please see the Using the 
Steam Backup Feature topic.

## Moving Your Steam Installation

The following instructions are a simple way to move your Steam installation along with your games:

1. Exit the Steam client application.
2. Browse to the Steam installation folder for the Steam installation you would like to 
move (C:\Program Files\Steam by default).
3. Delete all of the files and folders except the SteamApps folder and Steam.exe
4. Cut and paste the whole Steam folder to the new location, for example: D:\Games\Steam\
5. Launch Steam and log into your account.

Steam will briefly update and then you will be logged 
into your account. For installed games, verify your game 
cache files and you will be ready to play. All future game 
content will be downloaded to the new folder (D:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\ in this example)
