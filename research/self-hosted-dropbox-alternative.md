Self Hosted Dropbox Alternative
===============================

## Problem
- Dropbox Pro is expensive
- Dropbox stopped providing change logs
- Does not give me control over my data
- Do not have the infrastructure to push large amounts of data into the cloud

## Requirements
- Make selected files available to certain people
    - Similar to Dropbox 'Share Link' feature
- Make files available over the internet without having to upload them to the cloud first
- Self Hosted
- Open Source
- Version Control. Keep track of changes.
